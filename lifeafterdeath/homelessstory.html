            <h4>Reporting Methods</h4>
            <p>North By Northwestern reporters and photographers gathered audio and took photos on multiple trips with Colleen Cannon to the various sites described in this story. Features reporter Kate Stein and video editor Rose McBride also conducted a two-hour sit-down interview with Cannon at the Evanston Public Library. Stein later conducted a 40-minute follow-up interview with Cannon at the Evanston Public Library, as well.</p>

<p>Further, Stein accompanied Cannon to Hilda's Place to photograph Cannon cleaning out her locker. After Stein left, Cannon returned to Hilda's Place and, on Stein's request, requested and received permission for North By Northwestern to publish the photographs.</p>

<p>Neither Stein nor North By Northwestern paid Cannon for her story. However, after Cannon moved out of Hilda's Place, Stein temporarily stored bags Cannon couldn't fit in her locker, and gave her temporary access to laundry and shower facilities. Additionally, following the two-hour interview, Stein purchased Cannon lunch. Finally, prior to reporting this story, Stein had lent Cannon a recorder, which Cannon said she intended to use to record instances of verbal abuse at Hilda’s Place. Cannon says no such recordings have been made. Stein did not ask Cannon to make those recordings, nor did Stein use those recordings in her reporting.</p>

<p>All photographs of Colleen Cannon and other members of Evanston's homeless community were taken with the photograph subjects' permission. Statistics used in this story were provided by Connections for the Homeless, which is the parent organization of Hilda's Place and the primary resource for homeless people in Evanston. </p>
