Colleen suddenly found herself looking for a new direction in life. She had a $60,000 severance package and didn't need to find a job again immediately. So, Colleen and her partner of 15 years spent two years and most of the money traveling. But then, her 15-year relationship ended.</p>

He invited Colleen to move back to the Miami area and be his part-time personal chef. In exchange, he offered Colleen her own bedroom and bathroom in his home. She accepted.
Colleen at first enjoyed living close to her childhood hometown and devoting time to cooking, her lifelong passion. But gradually, Colleen's former classmate became controlling. He forbade Colleen from visiting her friends. He made unwanted sexual advances.</p>

She spent three days hospitalized, heavily sedated and recovering from severe bruises and shock. After her release, Colleen went to a shelter for domestic abuse victims in Deerfield Beach, Florida. Three weeks later, the shelter staff&mdash;recognizing that Colleen had a college degree and work experience and was capable of supporting herself&mdash;offered to buy her a plane ticket anywhere in the country. Colleen chose Evanston.</p>

So, Colleen stayed at multiple shelters and used her monthly disability paycheck to spend some nights at hotels. She lived for a few weeks on Chicago's South Side with a Northwestern friend and his family. But Colleen often felt her presence was a burden on her friend, who has two severely disabled sons. So, Colleen spent some nights on the streets.<p>

        <p id="subtext">For several weeks in February, March and April of 2015, Colleen had a bed at Hilda's Place, an Evanston homeless shelter. But the insensitivity of staff members she says she experienced made living in the shelter intolerable for her. In particular, loud voices caused PTSD-related flashbacks of her abuser. So, when Colleen was asked to leave Hilda's Place for violating the curfew policy by spending two nights at a friend's house, she left readily. </p>

        <p id="subtext">Because Colleen has not been homeless for a full year, or homeless multiple times, she's not considered "chronically homeless" by local support organizations like Hilda's Place. However, in encounters at support organizations and on city streets, Colleen has befriended many of the approximately 97 chronically homeless individuals in Evanston. Unlike nearly all of these individuals, Colleen has a college degree and no history of mental health problems or substance abuse issues.

She often starts her day by visiting with homeless friends in Panera, which allows patrons to drink water and use restrooms without making purchases. Next, Colleen typically walks to St. Mark's Episcopal Church, where she chats with acquaintances over a free breakfast offered on weekdays. Then, Colleen often goes to sit in Whole Foods or the Evanston Public Library, where she frequently encounters more homeless friends resting or using the library's computers.

Colleen is grateful that Hilda's Place offers her these resources. But she says she's extremely frustrated with the shelter and other area homeless shelters because they don't provide emotional support.</p>

There, she generally tries to get a few hours of sleep in one of the chairs of the periodicals section. When the university library closes at 3 a.m., she often goes to the 24-hour Burger King on Clark Street. The manager there allows homeless people to sleep in the booths until 6 a.m. Sometimes, though, Colleen spends nights in what she calls Evanston's "cubbies"&mdash;lobbies, buildings or other quiet places where she can get a few hours of relatively undisturbed rest.</p>

Colleen struggles to maintain a professional appearance when wearing donated and secondhand clothes and carrying the bags that don't fit in her locker at Hilda's Place. Her lack of regular Internet access makes it hard for prospective employers to contact her. And, from short nights of interrupted sleep at Burger King and elsewhere, Colleen's often so exhausted that she can't concentrate during interviews.</p>

            <h4 id="creds">Reporting Methods</h4>
            <p id="endplate">North By Northwestern reporters and photographers gathered audio and took photos on multiple trips with Colleen Cannon to the various sites described in this story. Features reporter Kate Stein and video editor Rose McBride also conducted a two-hour sit-down interview with Cannon at the Evanston Public Library. Stein later conducted a 40-minute follow-up interview with Cannon at the Evanston Public Library, as well.</p>

<p id="endplate">Further, Stein accompanied Cannon to Hilda's Place to photograph Cannon cleaning out her locker. After Stein left, Cannon returned to Hilda's Place and, on Stein's request, requested and received permission for North By Northwestern to publish the photographs.</p>

<p id="endplate">Neither Stein nor North By Northwestern paid Cannon for her story. However, after Cannon moved out of Hilda's Place, Stein temporarily stored bags Cannon couldn't fit in her locker, and gave her temporary access to laundry and shower facilities. Additionally, following the two-hour interview, Stein purchased Cannon lunch. Finally, prior to reporting this story, Stein had lent Cannon a recorder, which Cannon said she intended to use to record instances of verbal abuse at Hilda's Place. Cannon says no such recordings have been made. Stein did not ask Cannon to make those recordings, nor did Stein use those recordings in her reporting.</p>

<p id="endplate">All photographs of Colleen Cannon and other members of Evanston's homeless community were taken with the photograph subjects' permission. Statistics used in this story were provided by Connections for the Homeless, which is the parent organization of Hilda's Place and the primary resource for homeless people in Evanston. </p>
